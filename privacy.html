      <br>
     ‚ÄúService‚Äù refers to our services which can be accessed on our website at
      https://www.techlore.tech. The terms ‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúus,‚Äù and ‚Äúour‚Äù refer to Techlore, Inc. ‚ÄúYou‚Äù refers to you, as a user of

        <div>
          By accessing our website & Services, you accept our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.
          <br><br>
          Each time you visit our website, or use the Service, and any time you voluntarily provide us with information,
          you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide.
        </div>

        <summary> II. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</summary>
        <div>
          <b>Our Goal Is To Not Know Who You Are</b><br><br> To protect our hinds, we will state: We may collect both ‚ÄúNon-Personal Information‚Äù and ‚ÄúPersonal Information‚Äù about you.
          <br><br>
          <li>‚ÄúNon-Personal Information‚Äù includes information that cannot be directly used to personally identify you, such as
          basic browser information (Ex. Firefox on Linux) This is standard on most hosting services.</li>
          <br><br>
          <li>‚ÄúPersonal Information‚Äù includes information that can be used to personally identify you, such as your name and
          email address. This is never collected unless you optionally communicate with us by email or another contact method. We don't typically verify the information supplied, so you have every ability to use aliases when contacting us. We have several recommendations for aliasing services in our <a href="./resources.html#alias">resources.</a></li>
          <br><br>
          <li>We do not utilize cookies, we don't track you through scripts, and we do not implement trackers on our website to analyze your behavior. The only exception to this is our YouTube content embedded on this website which may have the indirect ability of tracking users. We recommend using browser tools to block trackers that may be used by the embedded tool if this concerns you - or alternatively you may disable Javascript, though this may break some other tools on our site.</li>

          <br><br>
          <li>In rare scenarios, a third-party may be involved in handling your information to provide a Service. Generally, these third-parties will only collect, use and disclose your information

          <br><br>
          <li>It's important to mention certain third-party service providers, such as payment processors, have their own privacy policies we have no control over. We recommend you read their privacy policies so that you can understand
          the
          manner in which your Personal Information will be handled by such providers. We aim to offer more private alternatives to users when the option is available.</li>
          <br><br>
